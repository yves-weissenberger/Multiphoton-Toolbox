# Installation

The package has many dependencies so by far the easiest way to install the package is to download <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/"> Anaconda 2.7</a>. Thereafter only two additional packages need to be installed. These are:

<li> tifffile </li>
<li> pyqtgraph </li>

For windows the former is easily installed from <a href="https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#tifffile"> here </a>, the latter from <a href="http://www.pyqtgraph.org/"> here </a>.

Thereafter simply download the repository and install it by running

    pip install . 

in the first twoptb directory (i.e. the one containing setup.py).
